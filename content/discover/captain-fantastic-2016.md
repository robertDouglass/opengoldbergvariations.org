Several pieces from the Goldberg Variations are heard in Captain Fantastic during a scene where the father, Ben (Viggo Mortensen), is discussing human sexuality with his daughters.

##  What's a bordello?

As a father, Ben feircely believes in raising smart, independent, and strong children, guided by their own innate curiosity. The scene takes place during the camper bus ride from the wilderness to civilisation where the family will attempt to give their recently deceased mother a proper burial. The first part of the scene is between Ben and his eldest daughter, who is reading Nabakov's "Lolita".

Ben: <cite>What are you reading? Lolita? I didn't assign that book.</cite>

Older Daughter: <cite>I'm skipping ahead.</cite>

Ben: <cite>And?</cite>

Older Daughter: <cite>It's "interesting".</cite>

 Other children: <cite>Interesting. Illegal word! Kiera said "interesting".</cite>
 
 Ben: <cite>"Interesting" is a non-word. You know you're supposed to avoid it. Be specific.</cite>
 
 Older Daughter: <cite>It's disturbing.</cite>
 
 Ben: <cite>More specific.</cite>
 
 ...
 
 Older Daughter: <cite>Beause it's written from his perspective, you sort of understand and sympathize with him. which is kind of amazing because he's essentially a child molester. But his love for her, it's beautiful. But it's also sort of a trick, because it's so wrong; he's hold and he basically rapes her. So, it makes me feel.... I hate him. And somehow I feel sorry for him at the same time.</cite>

The conversation becomes really interesting when Ben's youngest daughter, listening in, starts to ask her own questions. 

## What does rape mean?

Ben: <cite>When a person usually a man, forces another person usually a woman, to have sexual intercourse.</cite>
 
 <cite>Who's hungry?</cite>
 
 Youngest daughter: <cite>What's sexual intercourse?</cite>
 
 Ben: <cite>When a man sticks his penis in a woman's vagina. Everyone keep their eyes peeled for deer.</cite>
 
 Youngest daughter: <cite>Why would a man stick his penis in a woman's vagina?</cite>
 
 Ben: <cite>Because it can give them both pleasure. And because the combination of a man's sperm and a woman's egg can create a baby and continue the human race.</cite>
 
 Youngest daughter: <cite>But that's where she pees...</cite>
 
 <cite>Pee comes not from the vagina, but from the urethra.</cite>

Clearly, Ben is very dedicated to his chosen pedagogical philosophy. He does seem somewhat uncomfortable with the exchange, though. Less uncomfortable than during the mountain climbing scene earlier in the film, where his son incurs an injury while climbing a sheer cliff!

Here is BWV 988, Variation 25 A 2 Clav.: Adagio. from the Goldberg Variations.
