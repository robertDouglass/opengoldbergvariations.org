Several pieces from the Goldberg Variations are heard in Captain Fantastic during a scene where the father, Ben (Viggo Mortensen), is discussing human sexuality with his daughters.

##  What does rape mean?

As a father, Ben feircely believes in raising smart, independent, and strong children, guided by their own innate curiosity. The scene takes place during the camper bus ride from the wilderness to civilisation where the family will attempt to give their recently deceased mother a proper burial. The first part of the scene is between Ben and his eldest daughter, who is reading Nabakov's "Lolita".

Ben: <cite>What are you reading? Lolita? I didn't assign that book.</cite>

Older Daughter: <cite>I'm skipping ahead.</cite>

Ben: <cite>And?</cite>

Older Daughter: <cite>It's "interesting".</cite>

 Other children: <cite>Interesting. Illegal word! Kiera said "interesting".</cite>
 
 Ben: <cite>"Interesting" is a non-word. You know you're supposed to avoid it. Be specific.</cite>
 
 Older Daughter: <cite>It's disturbing.</cite>
 
 Ben: <cite>More specific.</cite>
 
 ...
 
 Older Daughter: <cite>Beause it's written from his perspective, you sort of understand and sympathize with him. which is kind of amazing because he's essentially a child molester. But his love for her, it's beautiful. But it's also sort of a trick, because it's so wrong; he's hold and he basically rapes her. So, it makes me feel.... I hate him. And somehow I feel sorry for him at the same time.</cite>

Hanna is playing on a broken piano when an Indian Sikh appears to warn her of possible mines, left behind by the Germans. Hanna jokes with him "Maybe you're safe as long as you only play Bach", reasoning that the mine would not go off if Germanic music were played.

## I'll probably marry him

Later, Hanna tells the English Patient that she'll probably marry that Indian Sikh, because her mother always told her that she would summon her future husband by playing the piano.
