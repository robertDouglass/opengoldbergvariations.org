The first piece from Bach's Goldberg Variations, the famous "Aria", is used to great effect in the movie "The Silence of the Lambs".

## Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry

Hannibal Lecter's most famous quote, "Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry", is delivered at the end of the scene, when it seems the violence and tension have subsided. The scene ends with Hannibal, knife in hand, walking after the ailing Sergent Pembry, and the viewer has no way of knowing exactly what he has in mind. Little do we know that Hannibal's intent is worse than our imaginations ever could be!

## Mind the drawings, please.

Watch and listen to the "Aria" from this scene at the beginning of the Open Goldberg Variations video.
