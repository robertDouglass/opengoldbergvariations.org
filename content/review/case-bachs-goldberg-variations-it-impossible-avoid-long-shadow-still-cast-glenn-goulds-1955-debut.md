For me, listening to Variation 23, it seemed, in comparison to Gould, that she was slurring, or possibly misspoke; but on repeated listenings, it became clear to me that I had become so conditioned by Gould's over-articulation that I mistook personality for a character flaw. Gould's performance is a stunning technical feat, but he does come off as somewhat as an android in comparison to Ishizaka's more human interpretation.
