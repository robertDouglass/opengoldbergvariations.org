Her tempi are steady, and her dynamics remain true to the Baroque interpretation of the term. The aria is pensive and quiet, as are some of the less elaborate, slower variations, delicate in places, yet full of depth and expression. The more elaborate, more up-tempo variations have a restrained exuberance, rippling and sparkling like a brook in the midday sun.
