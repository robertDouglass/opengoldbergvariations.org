>"She has the fleet fingers to speed through the virtuoso variations with compelling clarity and the sensitivity to probe the dramatic potential of the slower, more profound numbers, pleasurably aided by her consistently lovely tone."

*Robert Schulslaper, Issue 36:1 (Sept/Oct 2012), Fanfare Magazine*
 
>"... there is always a feeling of spontaneity and life in her performances; if anything, one feels that the pianist sees many of these variations almost like Baroque dance movements ..."
 
>"Variation 9, the canon at the third, and Variation 13 are both lovely examples of her style with its dips in dynamcs, subtle rubato, and slight ornamentation on the repeats, aspects that work in her performance because they all feel very natural."
 
*Scott Noriega, Issue 36:1 (Sept/Oct 2012), Fanfare Magazine*
