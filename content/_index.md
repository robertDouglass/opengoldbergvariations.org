## What People Say

> "Ishizaka's interpretation is characterised by straightforward musicianship, immaculate technical aplomb and a warm, beautifully modulated sonority."

> "Counterpoint passes back and forth between the hands in a conversational and judiciously balanced manner"

*Jed Distler, Gramophone Magazine, 2012*

> "She has the fleet fingers to speed through the virtuoso variations with compelling clarity and the sensitivity to probe the dramatic potential of the slower, more profound numbers, pleasurably aided by her consistently lovely tone."

*Robert Schulslaper, Issue 36:1 (Sept/Oct 2012), Fanfare Magazine*

>"Most importantly, the playing is excellent. Taken together with its no-cost availability and its reliance on a new freely available score, the Open Goldberg is now the obvious first stop for anyone approaching the Goldberg Variations for the first time."

>"The sound quality of the recording is top notch"

>"In fact, the album's an audiophile gem."

*Christopher Lim in The Business Times, July 20, 2012*
